# Module 2

## Objectives 

* Introduce objects and object-oriented programming
* Understand the predefined methods in Java
* Learn how to use input and output dialog boxes in a program
* Analyze the class String

### Problem 2-3

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the mass of a person in
kilograms and outputs the equivalent weight in pounds.  Output both the
mass and the weight rounded to two decimal places. (Note that for
standard Earth gravity, 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds.) Format your output
with two decimal places. 

Your answer should use dialog boxes for the input/output statements.
